# Telecommunications customer retention

This data science project centres on the problem of predicting whether or not customers of a telecommunications company will cancel their subscription. These predictions are based on information about the customers and their services, such as their gender, how long they have been with the company, and what kind of internet connection they have. The dataset used is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

I used a random forest classifier to make predictions, and this was around 78% accurate (with ~78% recall for both customers who stayed and customers who left). This is pretty high performance considering the inherent difficulty of predicting human behaviour using limited information (19 different variables).
